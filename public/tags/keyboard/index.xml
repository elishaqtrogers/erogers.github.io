      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’d like to consider myself something of a nerd. (Maybe even a &lt;em&gt;geek&lt;/em&gt;, if you will.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the past few months, I found myself interested again in ergonomic keyboards, alternative keyboard layouts, and more recently home row modifications. At first, I started watching some episodes of Xah Lee’s &lt;em&gt;Xah Talk Show&lt;/em&gt; focusing specifically on keyboard reviews, and more importantly their ergonomics. His knowledge on the subject is fairly extensive, and with the company of &lt;a href=&#34;https://xahlee.info&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt;, peering into the world of keyboards was a trivial task. Of course, I didn’t &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; look to Xah for keyboard knowledge. I also looked around on YouTube to hear what people had to say about the subject matter. Video format is possibly the best format to gain insight on physical items like keyboards, as the content creator can &lt;em&gt;show you&lt;/em&gt; in real time what works and what doesn’t for a given product. After binging a bit too many videos, I came to the conclusion that I would buy an ergonomic keyboard (within my budget).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
