title: About Me
---

I am an aspiring information technology analyst and cybersecurity consultant passionate about leveraging networking fundamentals, operating systems knowledge, cloud platforms, and vulnerability assessment to solve the problem of vulnerable digital infrastucture in critical environments and ensure businesses are able to operate with little-to-no room for malicious actors to compromise.

My decision to pursue this field of work came from a love for technology and an ever-growing realization of how easy it is for us to grow complacent and create holes in what should be a nigh-impenetrable wall.
